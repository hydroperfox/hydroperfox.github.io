        <p>
            The Whack™ engine will allow client side and server side interactive applications
            to be built using ActionScript 3, targeting HTML5 and Node.js®.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once ActionScript 3 support lands, two additional languages, MXML and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS),
            will be in the implementation road, which will be a 1-1 mapping to ActionScript 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Whack™ is not a Flash Player implementation; it is a brand new platform
            with many fundamental differences including the API and project setup.
